  ## Why monitor XGBoost?
  Monitoring XGBoost workflows and applications is essential for ensuring the performance, reliability, scalability, and continuous improvement of machine learning applications.
  
  ## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for XGBoost
  XGBoost tracks various aspects of your model training process, resource utilization, and model performance.
  
  ## Whatâ€™s included in this quickstart?
  New Relic XGBoost monitoring quickstart provides quality out-of-the-box reporting:
  - Performance optimization: Identify performance bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement in your dmlcXGBoost-based machine learning models
  - Resource management: Monitoring helps ensure efficient use of CPU, memory, and GPU resources, preventing resource contention and optimizing infrastructure utilization
  - Error detection and debugging: Monitoring captures and logs errors, exceptions, and unexpected behavior during model training and inference
  - Security and compliance: Monitoring helps detect unusual or suspicious activity in your machine learning applications, contributing to data security and regulatory compliance efforts
  - Hyperparameter tuning: Tracking model evaluation metrics and training progress metrics allows you to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize your dmlcXGBoost models for better performance

summary: |
  Integrate your XGBoost applications with New Relic to monitor and optimize their performance.
